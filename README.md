# react-carousel v1.0

Custom React Carousel component designed without the use of external transition libraries. 

Components are designed using React with Styled-Components as a CSS-in-JS approach. 

Images displayed in the Carousel are swipeable on mobile/touch-enabled devices; 
alternatively, the user may scroll through images using the left or right buttons.
X-axis translation values are passed from the React component into the Styled-Component as props on mobile.
